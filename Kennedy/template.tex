		\item I have worked on several projects since July 2022. Let me mention two of the projects I have done.
		\item Starting July up until November 2022, I have worked on creating an expert advisor using the MQL5 programming language that can allow me to trade currency derivatives in the forex market. This project was inspired by the potential of forex industry and also my love for mathematics. I created several working expert advisors however, after testing them with artificial money, the results were not profitable and hence I had to go back to the drawing board to figure out how to create profitable expert advisors.
		\item Starting November 2022 to date, while I am in the process of researching the financial industry to understand the factors that contribute to a successful and profitable trading strategy, I have been working on developing a hybrid application that can function on both android and ios. In this project, I had to learn flutter, dart, and firebase programming languages. It has been quite the adventure because through this project, I have learnt the important of resilience and patience in application development.
